## Another Personal Blog.

Oh dear, it's that urge again. Time to write another blog engine. 


### BUT Y THO
 
This one is to allow me to set up another personal website that I can use as a blog to once again claw myself up the career ladder. Also, I am feeling the urge to sharpen up my visual design skills. It has been well over a decade since I designed a personal site and that seems quite exciting.


### Technology

Elixir, Phoenix. For the front end I'll be throwing in some Typescript based react for UI. I don't imagine I'll be doing a front-end role in my day work, so staying sharp on my own dime seems like a good idea.
