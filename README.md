## Not Another Blog.

This is not another blog engine per se, but it is built around one. However this time I will engage in the aethetic and creative visual process. I want to design something that...

* communicates the CPD I'm engaged in
* is aesethetically pleasing to me and reflective of the styles I very much enjoy
* has interactivity and "real-timeness" about it.


### Technology

Elixir with Phoenix and a good dose of LiveViews. I'm feeling like I want to get into some interaction data animations so I'll see where that ends up. I've no idea what tech I'll use for that right now.
