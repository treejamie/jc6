## Another Personal Blog.

Oh dear, it's that urge again. Time to write another blog engine. 


### BUT Y THO
 
This one is to allow me to set up another personal website that I can use as a blog to once again claw myself up the career ladder. Also, I am feeling the urge to sharpen up my visual design skills. It has been well over a decade since I designed a personal site and that seems quite exciting.


### Technology

Elixir with Phoenix and a good dose of LiveViews. I'm feeling like I want to get into some interaction data animations so I'll see where that ends up. I've no idea what tech I'll use for that right now.
